# **Voluntify**

A web application to create and manage volunteers and volunteering events. 

## **Installation**

Before running the project, ensure the following are installed:
- Node.js
- npm
Usually npm is included when installing Node.js
  
To set up Voluntify, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: **`git clone https://github.com/AndrewN2001/4353Group47.git`**
2. It is recommended you have two terminals open to run both the frontend and backend
3. Navigate to the project directory: **`cd frontend`** and **`cd backend`**
4. Install dependencies: **`npm install`** for both frontend and backend

## **Usage**

To use Voluntify, follow these steps:

1. Open the project to the correct directory as listed in *Installation*
2. Start the project: **`npm start`** for frontend and **`node index.js`** for backend

## **Troubleshooting**

1. The main solution for backend running is to remove the node_modules folder from the directory and reinstall:
   While in the backend directory, try running **`Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .\node_modules\`** if you are using a PowerShell terminal. Next, run **`npm install`** to reinstall the folder.
